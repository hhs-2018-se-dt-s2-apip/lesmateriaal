### 2.3 Concatenation or combining strings

Let us take a closer look on combining strings with the + operator.

If the + operator is used between two strings, a new string is created with the two strings combined. Note the clever use of space characters in the values of the variables below!

```java
String greeting = "Hi ";
String name = "John";
String goodbye = ", and goodbye!";

String sentence = greeting + name + goodbye;

System.out.println(sentence);
```

```output
Hi John, and goodbye!
```

If a string is on either side of the + operator, the other side is converted to a string and a new string is created. For example, the integer 2 will be converted into the string "2" and then combined with the other string.


```java
System.out.println("there is an integer --> " + 2);
System.out.println(2 + " <-- there is an integer");
```

What we learned earlier about the order of operations is still valid:

```java
System.out.println("Four: " + (2 + 2));
System.out.println("But! Twenty-two: " + 2 + 2);
```

```output
Four: 4
But! Twenty-two: 22
```

Using this information, we can print a mix of strings and values of variables:

```java
int x = 10;

System.out.println("variable x has the following value: " + x);

int y = 5;
int z = 6;

System.out.println("y has the value  " + y + " and z has the value " + z);
```

This program obviously prints:

```output
variable x has the following value: 10
y has the value 5 and z has the value 6
```
