### 1.6 Main program body

The body for a program named "Example" is as follows:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // program code
    }
}
```

The program is stored in a text file named after the program with the *.java* extension. For a program named *Example*, the file should be named `Example.java`.

The execution of the program begins at the part marked with the *// program code* comment above. During our first week of programming, we will limit ourselves to this part. When we are talking about commands such as printing, we need to write the commands into the program body. For example: `System.out.print("Text to be printed");`

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Text to be printed");
    }
}
```

From this point on, the main program body will be omitted from the examples.
