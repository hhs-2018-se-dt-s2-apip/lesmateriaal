## 3.1. More about methods

### 3.1.1 Methods and visibility of variables

Let us try to change from within a method the value of a variable located in the main program.

```java
// main program
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 1;
    addThree();
}

// method
public static void addThree() {
    number = number + 3;
}
```

Unfortunately this program will not work, because the method cannot "see" the variable `number` located in the main program.

This holds generally. Variables defined in the main program are not visible for other methods. Also, the other way is similar: variables defined in methods are not visible for other methods or the main program. The only way to give information to a method from the outside is to use parameters.

```java
// main program
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 1;
    System.out.println("Main program variable number holds the value: " + number);
    addThree(number);
    System.out.println("Main program variable number holds the value: " + number);
}

// method
public static void addThree(int number) {
    System.out.println("Method parameter number holds the value: " + number);
    number = number + 3;
    System.out.println("Method parameter number holds the value: " + number);
}
```

In the program above the method addThree has a parameter called `number`. This parameter is copied (duplicated) for the method to use. When the program above is executed we see the following output:

```output
Main program variable number holds the value: 1
Method parameter number holds the value: 1
Method parameter number holds the value: 4
Main program variable number holds the value:  1
```

The number we gave as a parameter to the method was *copied* for the method to use. If we would like the main program to be able to use the new value generated by the method, the method needs to return that value.

### 3.1.2 Return values

A method can return a value. In the examples above, methods have not been returning anything. This is expressed by writing `void` in the first line of the method, just before it's name.

```java
public static void addThree() {
  ...
```

When defining a method that returns a value, we also have to define the type of the return value. We can define the type of the return value by writing it just before the name of the method. Next, we have a method that always returns the number 10 (type int). Returning a value is accomplished with the command return:

```java
public static int alwaysReturnTen() {
    return 10;
}
```

If we want to use the returned value later, we have to catch the return value and store it into a variable:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = alwaysReturnTen();

    System.out.println( "method returned the number " + number );
}
```

The return value of the method is assigned to a variable of type int just like any other integer. The return value can also be a part of a sentence:

```java
double number = 4 * alwaysReturnTen() + (alwaysReturnTen() / 2) - 8;

System.out.println( "calculation total " + number );
```

Every variable type we have seen this far can be used as a return value:

```java
public static void methodThatReturnsNothing() {
  // method body
}

public static int methodThatReturnsInteger() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}

public static String methodThatReturnsText() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}

public static double methodThatReturnsFloatingpoint() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}
```

If the method is defined to have a return value, it also has to return a value. The following method is incorrect:

```java
public static String wrongMethod() {
    System.out.println("I tell you that I will return a String but I do not!");
}
```

In the following example, we define a method for calculating a sum. Then, we use the method to calculate 2 + 7. The return value (returned after the method call) is assigned to a variable called `sumNumbers`.

```java
public static int sum(int first, int second) {
    return first + second;
}
```

Method call:

```java
int sumNumbers = sum(2, 7);
// sumNumbers now holds the value 9
Let us expand the example program so that the user types the numbers.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Type the first number: ");
    int first = Integer.parseInt( reader.nextLine() );

    System.out.print("Type the second number: ");
    int second = Integer.parseInt( reader.nextLine() );

    System.out.print("Total: " + sum(first,second) );
}

public static int sum(int first, int second) {
    return first + second;
}
```

As we can see, the return value of the method does not always need to be assigned to a variable. It can also act as a part of the printing command just like any other integer value.

In the next example, we call the method sum using integers that we get as return values from the method `sum`.

```java
int first = 3;
int second = 2;

sum(sum(1, 2), sum(first, second));
// 1) the inner methods are executed:
//    sum(1, 2) = 3   and sum(first, second) = 5
// 2) the outer method is executed:
//    sum(3, 5) = 8
```

### 3.1.3 The method's own variables

The following method calculates the average of the numbers the method gets as parameters. The method uses helper variables sum and average. The method's own variables can be introduced just like any other variables.

```java
public static double average(int number1, int number2, int number3) {

    int sum = number1 + number2 + number3;
    double average = sum / 3.0;

    return average;
}
```
