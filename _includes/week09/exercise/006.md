>> ### Exercise 5-4: File Manager
>>
>>Together with the exercise body, you find the class `FileManager`, which contains the method bodies to read a write a file.
>>
>>#### Exercise 5-4.1: File Reading
>>
>>Implement the method `public ArrayList<String> read(String file)` to return the lines of the parameter file in `ArrayList` form, each file line being a `String` contained by the `ArrayList`.
>>
>>There are two text files to help testing the project: *src/testinput1.txt* and *src/testinput2.txt*. The methods are supposed to be used in the following way:
>>
>>```java
>> public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
>>     FileManager f = new FileManager();
>>
>>     for (String line : f.read("src/testinput1.txt")) {
>>         System.out.println(line);
>>     }
>> }
>>```
>>
>>The print output should look like the following
>>
>>```output
>>first
>>second
>>```
>>
>>#### Exercise 5-4.2: Writing a Line
>>
>>Modify the method `public void save(String file, String text)` so that it writes the String `text` into the `file`. If the file already exists, overwrite its contents.
>>
>>#### Exercise 5-4.3: Writing an ArrayList
>>
>>Modify the method `public void save(String file, ArrayList<String> texts)` so that it writes the content of the ArrayList `texts` into the `file`. If the file already exists, overwrite its contents.
