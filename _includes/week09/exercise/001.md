>> ### Exercise 5-1: Method Argument Validation
>>
>> Let's train method argument validation with the help of the `IllegalArgumentException`. The excercise layout shows two classes `Person` and `Calculator`. Change the class in the following way:
>>
>> #### Exercise 5-1.1: Person Validation
>>
>> The constructor of `Person` has to make sure its parameter's `name` variable is not null, empty, or longer than 40 characters. The age has also to be between 0-120. If one of the conditions above are not satisfied, the constructor has to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
>>
>> #### Exercise 5-1.2: Calculator Validation
>>
>> The `Calculator` methods have to be changed in the following way: the method `multiplication` has to work only if its parameter is not negative (greater than or equal to 0). The method `binomialCoefficient` has to work only if the parameters are not negative and the size of a subset is smaller than the set's size. If one of the methods receives invalid arguments when they are called, they have to throw a `IllegalArgumentException`.
>>
>> #### Exercise 5-1.3: Exception handling
>> The `main` method crashes when an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
>> Add proper exception handling so that the main method does not crash any more.
>> Print the exception information, so that the program shows what goes wrong.
>> NB: This part of the exercise is not verified automatically.
