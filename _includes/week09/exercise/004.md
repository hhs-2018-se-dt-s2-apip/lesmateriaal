>> ### Exercise 5-3: File Analysis
>>
>> In this exercise, we create an application to calculate the number of lines and characters.
>>
>> Implement the method readFile(). Read the file using a scanner and append all the lines to the variable 'str'. Add a 'new line' character at then end of every line.
>>
>> You can decide yourself what to do if the constructor parameter file does not exist.
>>
>> The file *testFile* has been place into the test package of your project to help the tests. When you define the file name of the constructor of `Analysis`, you have to write *test/testfile.txt*. The file contains the following text:
>>
>>```output
>>there are 3 lines, and characters
>>because line breaks are also
>>characters
>>```
>>
>>The following example shows what the program should do:
>>
>>```java
>> File file = new File("test/testfile.txt");
>> Analysis analysis = new Analysis(file);
>> System.out.println("Lines: " + analysis.lines());
>> System.out.println("Characters: " + analysis.characters());
>>```
>>
>>```output
>>Lines: 3
>>Characters: 74
>>```
